# ease.js

ease.js is (to be) a basic collection of CommonJS modules intended to
"ease" the transition into JavaScript from other Object-Oriented languages. It
provides an intuitive means of achieving classical inheritance and has planned
support for interfaces, abstract classes and traits.

**This project is still under development.**

## Why ease.js?
There are already plenty of other means of achieving each of this project's
goals, so what's the point of ease.js? The aim of the project is to provide a
lightweight library in a CommonJS format which also addresses ES5 issues and is
an all-inclusive solution to OO techniques. It satisfies primarily a personal
itch.
