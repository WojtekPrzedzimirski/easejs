Installing
==========

For information on installing ease.js on your system, see INSTALL.
Alternatively, you may install the software using npm by issuing the
following command:

  $ npm install easejs



Configuring
===========

If your distribution contains a `configure' file in the project root, you
may jump immediately to INSTALL.

Otherwise, you likely have the sources as they exist in the project
repository, which does not contain the generature `configure' script; you
may generate it by issuing the following commands:

  $ aclocal && automake --foreign && autoconf

Please note that the --foreign argument is necessary to `automake' to ignore
certain missing files (such as ChangeLog) that are generated at build time.
