        ease.js is a collection of CommonJS modules intended to &ldquo;ease&rdquo;
        the transition into JavaScript from other Object-Oriented languages. It
        provides an intuitive means of achieving classical inheritance and has
        planned support for traits/mixins, function overloading and more.
      </p>

      <p>
        ease.js is a framework. It is not a compiler. This allows you to use it
        wherever JavaScript may be used, including with other compilers/parsers.
        It provides support for older, pre-ES5 browsers by gracefully dropping
        features (such as visibility), but remaining functionally consistent.
        Therefore, code written using ease.js should operate exactly the same in
        Internet Explorer 5.5 as it does in Chromium 10.
      </p>

        <strong>This project is under heavy development.</strong> However, the
        <tt>master</tt> branch is always guaranteed to be in a working, stable
        state. It is currently in use within a production system at the author's
        place of employment. Feel free to use ease.js in your own projects.
