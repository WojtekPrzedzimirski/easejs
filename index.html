  ease.js is a Classical Object-Oriented framework for JavaScript,
  intended to &ldquo;ease&rdquo; the transition into JavaScript from other
  Object-Oriented languages. Features include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simple and intuitive class definitions</li>
  <li>Classical inheritance</li>
  <li>Abstract classes and methods</li>
  <li>Interfaces</li>
  <li>Access modifiers (public, protected and private)</li>
  <li>Static and constant members</li>
</ul>

<p>
  ease.js is a framework, not a compiler. It may be used wherever
  JavaScript may be used, including with other compilers/parsers. ease.js
  also provides support for older, pre-ES5 environments by gracefully
  degrading features (such as visibility support), but remaining
  functionally consistent.

  <strong>This project is under heavy development.</strong> However, the
  <tt>master</tt> branch is always guaranteed to be in a working, stable
  state. It is currently in use within a production system at the author's
  place of employment. Feel free to use ease.js in your own projects.
