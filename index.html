  ease.js is a Classical Object-Oriented framework for JavaScript,
  intended to &ldquo;ease&rdquo; the transition into JavaScript from other
  Object-Oriented languages. Features include:

<div class="ex excode">
  <!--%inc scripts/ex/class.js -->
</div>

<ul class="features">
  <li>Simple and intuitive class definitions</li>
  <li>Classical inheritance</li>
  <li>Abstract classes and methods</li>
  <li>Interfaces</li>
  <li>Access modifiers (public, protected and private)</li>
  <li>Static and constant members</li>
</ul>

<p class="info">
  ease.js is a framework, not a compiler. It may be used wherever
  JavaScript may be used, including with other compilers/parsers. ease.js
  also provides support for older, pre-ES5 environments by gracefully
  degrading features (such as visibility support), but remaining
  functionally consistent.
