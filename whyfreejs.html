  The Importance of JavaScript that Respects Your Freedoms
</h3>

  It occurred to me that when we announce ease.js it would be a good occasion to
  post something about the importance of making JavaScript code free.

  GNU ease.js is in a position to help the free software community by providing
  features under a copyleft license that encourages developers to release their
  own code under a compatible free software license. But not everyone may
  understand why this decision and the urging of free (as in freedom) JavaScript
  are so fundamentally <em>vital</em> to the future of a free and cooperative
  Internet accessible to <em>all</em> users, including users of free software.

  <strong>We need your help to protect the fundamental freedoms of Internet
  users.</strong> This article is both a detailed description of the problem
  from the perspective of a user and an appeal to developers to develop free
  software for the Web; it is heavily influenced by Richard Stallman's article
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">The JavaScript
  Trap</a>&mdash;which you should also read&mdash;and has been written with his
  input. If you already write free JavaScript, then thank you.
