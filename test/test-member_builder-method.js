/**
 * One may question the purpose of this assertion. Why should we not permit
 * overriding properties with methods? It's useful to be able to store callbacks
 * and such within properties.
 *
 * Yes, it is. However, that would be misinterpreting the purpose of the method
 * builder. Here, we are working with prototypes, not class instances. If the
 * user wishes to assign a function to the property (so long as it's permitted
 * by the type definition) after the class is instantiated, he/she may go right
 * ahead. However, if we modify the prototype to use a function, then the
 * prototype will interpret the function as a method. As such, the method cannot
 * be overridden with a property in the future. To avoid this confusing
 * scenario, we'll prevent it from occurring entirely.
